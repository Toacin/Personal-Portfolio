# Personal Porfolio

## Description

**This repository includes all the files that make up my personal-portfolio webpage. My biggest motivation for developing this site was not only to have a webpage showcasing all my projects and works, but also to use it as an opportunity to excersize my newly-developed skills in both HTML and CSS**

### HTML
The developed HTML file will show an element structure akin to that of the deployed webpage, i.e. the webpage is structured in three main components: the moving header, top background image, middle content section, and bottom footer. Similarly, the HTML's main divisions follow the same structure with appropriate semantic elements: header, 1st section, 2nd section, and footer. Of course from there, each of these elements have their own appropriate child elements to hold the content of the webpage. Comments can be found to highlight the reasoning behind key decisions made throughout the project.

### CSS
The more challenging part of this project was applying the advanced CSS concepts I learned. The biggest undertaking was trying to use a property I was least confortable with: flexboxes. In fact, as you will see, I try to utilize flexboxes as much as I can to truly deepen my understanding of it's function and behavior. By the end, I felt I had very strong command over it and was easily able to design the page to follow my original vision. Aside from that, it was pretty simple to apply other rudimentary CSS properties to achieve the finished product. As with the HTML file, comments can be found to highlight the reasoning behind key decisions made throughout the project.

### Accessibility
A core tenet of my personal design philosophy has been to promote as much accessibility as possible, not only for end-users of my page, but also for co-developers. To practice such beliefs, I have adopted the appropriate semantic elements in my HTML file, along with alt tags and aria-labels for maximum screen reading accessibility. Updates will be made to this page as I develop more skills in this regard.
